Credit disbursement to the private sector for the full 2021-22, ending in June, should well exceed the Rs1 trillion mark.", "The government had stopped borrowing from the central bank even before the recent enactment of a law banned it. Already, the government has been relying on commercial banks for borrowing and its reliance on them has increased after having been refrained from central bank borrowing.", "But in order to save the private sector from the \u201ccrowding out\u201d effect, the government will have to moderate its borrowing from banks and explore some avenues of non-bank borrowings. That, however, seems too difficult. Net fresh investment in existing National Saving Schemes is not coming in. And, the introduction of any new schemes to raise non-bank borrowing \u2014 and that too in a high-interest rate regime \u2014 isn\u2019t that easy.", "On the other hand, the fiscal deficit still remains high despite growth in tax revenue, deepening the government\u2019s need to borrow from banks. Meanwhile, in spite of moderation this year in the pace of economic growth compared to last year, demand for private sector credit remains high.", "We must also look at whether banks\u2019 credit is distributed judiciously among provinces \u2014 and whether credit flows in urban and rural areas are equally satisfying or whether women and women-led businesses are getting enough bank finance", "This means banks will continue to have enough opportunities for investing and reinvesting in the treasury bills and bonds and for making fresh loans to the private sector.", "Meanwhile, bank deposits continue to grow on the back of economic growth and greater documentation of the economy \u2014 and also due to upward revision of returns on them following the tightening of the monetary policy. So it seems banks can, by and large, meet the borrowing requirements of both the government and the private sector.", "But that alone isn\u2019t enough. We must also look at whether banks\u2019 credit is distributed judiciously among provinces \u2014 and whether credit flows in urban and rural areas are equally satisfying or whether women and women-led businesses are getting enough bank finance.", "It is encouraging to note that disbursement of bank loans in Sindh has been rising in line with growing private sector activities in Karachi \u2014 the commercial and financial hub of Pakistan and the capital city of Sindh \u2014 and elsewhere in the province. In Jan-June 2016, bank advances made in Sindh constituted just about 50 per cent of the total. But this percentage kept growing and in Jan-June 2021, reached close to 53.4pc, a careful reading of the SBP stats reveal. The same holds true for Balochistan. Credit disbursement in this least-developed province also improved from a little less than 0.12pc of the total in Jan-June 2016 to a little more than 0.18pc in Jan-June 2021.", "However, even this elevated share is minuscule, rather negligible. Given the province\u2019s vast potential for indigenous China-Pakistan Economic Corridor driven progress in industrial, mining, fishing and services sectors, banks\u2019 lending to Balochistan\u2019s private sector can easily be raised to 1-2pc of the total in three to five years. The establishment of Balochistan Bank, on the lines of Sindh Bank and Punjab Bank, can help promote banking services in the province. But past promises to fulfil this oft-repeated demand of the people of Balochistan are yet to materialise.", "A more disturbing aspect of credit distribution across Pakistan is that credit flows towards rural areas remain too thin.", "In Sindh, where banks lend more than in any other province, the share of rural areas in outstanding volumes of bank advances stood at 2.74pc of the total as of June 2021", "For example, even in Sindh where banks lend more than in any other province, the share of rural areas in outstanding volumes of bank advances stood at 2.74pc of the total as of June 2021. The situation in Punjab was a little better though, with the share of rural areas at 5.27pc, SBP stats reveal.", "An even more worrying aspect of credit distribution is that female bank borrowers get a negligible share in total bank advances. That is perhaps why the central bank does not require banks to report gender-wise breakups of their loans. Only microfinance banks and institutions do this. As of Dec 2021, women borrowers made up 44pc of the total active borrowers of all kinds of microfinance but their share in the total loan portfolio of microfinance was 33pc, according to Pakistan Microfinance Network.", "But one must keep in mind that the number of all active borrowers of microfinance including men and women stood slightly above 8.122 million and the gross loan portfolio stood around Rs392.6m. In other words, the number of active women borrowers was a little less than 3.6m women and the volumes of microfinance outstanding against them were close to Rs133m.", "Women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) also get bank loans that are far larger than microfinance loans but the gender-wise breakup of SME loans are not made public by the central bank. If the SBP starts doing this, it would help people know what progress has so far been made to financially empower one half of our population.", "The stock of outstanding SME loans stood at Rs473.7 billion as of September 2021, according to SBP stats. Though this represented just a shade above 6pc of the total private sector loans, still sharing a gender-wise breakup of SME loans would mirror a better picture of women empowerment and financial inclusion than microfinance loans whose total portfolio (of Rs392.6m) makes up less than 0.1pc of the total SME loans \u2014 what to talk about overall private sector borrowings.", " Compunode.com Pvt.

He implied that Pakistan deserves a better deal with China.", "\u201cWith commodity headwinds likely to last another six months and the Saudi deposit now exhausted, even with the $1bn each from the International Monetary Fund and the Sukuk floatation, Pakistan will need further assistance. No doubt, the public announcement of the request for the $3bn Chinese loan followed a green light from China. To put this in proper context, the $3bn facility represents less than a quarter of China\u2019s annual exports to Pakistan.\u201d", "Mr Syed expected a reaffirmation from both sides to consolidate the second phase of CPEC, after the successful completion of the first phase. \u201cThe bilateral agenda is full: 2nd phase of CPEC, Pakistan-China coordination on regional issues of common interest, like Afghanistan and India, regional connectivity, and support to each other on their core interests.\u201d", "For Mr Malik, the real challenge is to attract the Chinese private sector which is relocating production to cheaper countries. \u201cTo make a case, the government should have conducted a detailed comparative exercise to project Pakistan as a better option compared to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh.

Estimates suggest that the country will need to import around four million tonnes of grain to meet the local shortfall.", "Pakistan had harvested a bumper crop and produced a record 28.75m tonnes of wheat last season. It had to import 2.2m tonnes of grain to meet local requirements and build strategic reserves of 1m tonnes. A 15pc loss in the yield means there will not be more than 25m tonnes wheat output this year.", " ", "The federal government had been eyeing a 30m tonnes wheat production target during 2021-22 and for this purpose had asked the provinces to increase their respective areas under grain cultivation and per acre yield by effectively utilising rust-resistant and certified seeds, water and proper usage of fertilisers and pesticides.", "The Wheat Review Committee that met in September had directed Punjab to enhance its wheat production from 20.9m tonnes in 2020-21 to 23m tonnes during the next crop season. Other provinces were also asked to help achieve the national wheat target of 30m tonnes. Sindh had reaped 4.04m tonnes, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 1.45m tonnes and Gilgit-Baltistan 1.15m tonnes grains last year.", "Wheat lost its acreage during the late sowing season when DAP and urea crises developed and the growers were diverted to alternative crops such as potatoes and oilseeds", "The committee established some parameters to effectively monitor wheat sowing. These parameters included achieving the target for the area under cultivation, sowing method (drilling or broadcasting), the quantum of fertiliser (both di-ammonium phosphate and urea) used during sowing, certified seeds, seed varieties (whether old or new should be rust tolerant), availability of herbicides and fertiliser, pricing status etc.", "Unfortunately, most of the parameters could not be met during the wheat sowing season. Punjab, which contributes around 76pc of the total wheat production, could sow only 16.21m acres against the target of 16.67m acres, a shortfall of over 500,000 acres. Similarly, there was a 17pc deficit of DAP offtake in the season because of its extraordinarily high rates, whereas urea compost sales posted a 12pc decline in January when it was most needed for the wheat crop.", "As far as certified seeds are concerned both the public and private sector could provide only 25pc of the required seeds \u2014 around 530,000 tonnes of seed, including 160,000 tonnes of rust-tolerant varieties. The rest of the demand was met by farmers\u2019 own retained crops.", "\u201cTargets cannot be achieved just through wishful thinking,\u201d says a senior official of the Punjab Agriculture Department. \u201cNo worthwhile measures were taken to ensure availability of fertiliser though the shortage of compost had begun to develop well before the sowing season. A decision on the minimum support price was also taken late and it has been matched with that of Sindh\u2019s price of Rs2,200 per 40kg only recently when even the late sowing season is over.\u201d", "Punjab Crop Reporting Service Director Dr Abdul Qayyum says the positive factor is that over 70pc of the wheat in the province had been sown in the most suitable time \u2014 between mid-November and mid-December. Warning that March rains will be damaging for the crop, he says wheat lost its acreage during the late sowing season when DAP and urea crises developed and the growers were diverted to alternative crops like potato and oilseeds.", "Barring a couple of years, however, the weather has not been supportive during the last six years as heavy pre-monsoon rains have been lashing the country in March. There are already reports of rust attacks from top wheat-producing districts of Bahawalnagar, Bahawalpur and Khanewal. The National Agromet Centre so far predicts two to three spells of light to moderate rains in March. Dr Qayyum says the rust attack so far is negligible but shall become serious in case of more rains.", "Ayub Agricultural Research Institute, Faisalabad, Director Dr Javed Ahmad fears a five to 15pc drop in the yield this season if the weather becomes unfavourable for all other factors that had led to achieving over 31.34 maunds per acre yield last year are negative this time. The wheat expert claims that the January showers robbed the plants of whatever nitrate was available in the soil, while poor application of DAP and urea would surely hit the growth and size of the grain. This would be over and above the yield loss due to the shrinking of the acreage, he adds.", "Stressing on the need for improving acreage and per acre yield, National Food Security and Research Minister Syed Fakhr Imam says five to six million people are added to the country\u2019s growing population every year, which is further increasing the demand for wheat in the country.", "This wheat shortage scenario will give sleepless nights to the country\u2019s financial managers already upset at the widening budgetary gap and critical foreign exchange position. Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin had asked the provincial governments to do something to control the rising food import bill. At the prevailing around $310 per tonne wheat prices in the global commodity market, Islamabad will need to spend over $1.2 billion to import 4m tonnes of grain.", "But all is not good in the world markets. Pakistan usually imports wheat from Russia and Ukraine. Reports suggest that Russian wheat output will decline in the marketing year 2021-22 because of dry and warm summers there. It has set its wheat export quota at 8.0m tonnes over Feb 15-June 30. And the prices may see volatility due to border tensions between Russia and Ukraine as commodity market observers fear the price may double in case of escalation in the tension.

Under the \u2018prior actions\u2019, the government had to withdraw Rs350bn worth of sales tax exemptions, approve a monthly increase in petroleum levy, increase electricity rates and cut the development programme by Rs200bn, making the combined impact at more than Rs550bn of the mini-budget announced in the last week of December.", "The fact that the government had to come up with two mini-budgets within a fiscal year brings the sanctity of the budget into question and the reversal of key measures within two months blemishes its economic management abilities", "Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin had assured the IMF that federal tax revenue would grow by more than 25pc, buttressed by durable fiscal reforms and tax administration efforts. \u201cIt will also be supported by higher environmental taxation by ensuring the petroleum development levy (PDL) on gasoline and diesel.

The fact that the government had to come up with two mini-budgets within eight months of the fiscal year raises question marks on the sanctity of the budget and reversal of key measures within a gap of two months blemishes financial and economic management abilities.", "The new amnesty scheme is seen as a departing gift to wealthy individuals and companies who may be playing a key role in the financing of the next elections. This is based on the premise that tax incentives had been provided to the industrial sector through Special Economic Zones, Export Processing Zones and Special Technology Zones and there was a need to extend it to other geographic zones to create employment, revive sick industrial units and encourage \u201centrepreneurs to invest in industrial undertakings out of their undisclosed assets\u201d besides the non-resident Pakistanis and resident Pakistani individuals to repatriate their foreign exchange into Pakistan and invest in the industry.", "Under the scheme, instead of about 49pc tax, including 24pc tax rate and 29pc penalty, a 5pc across-the-board tax rate will immune the investor from probe about his sources of investment as provided under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.

", "You probably have heard it all: from the outlandish ones predicting a crypto future with no place for fiat to how startups will dethrone existing financial services providers once Raast, the central bank\u2019s real-time micropayments gateway, truly takes/picks up pace. Earlier last week, we got one step closer to the latter as Prime Minister Imran Khan ", " the second phase \u2014 instant peer-to-peer payments \u2014 of Raast.  ", "What that means is now you can transfer money to anyone through Raast. If you are wondering, how does that change anything since the same task can be done via 1LINK\u2019s Interbank Funds Transfer (1IBFT)? For starters, the former is currently absolutely free \u201cin spirit to promote financial inclusion in Pakistan\u201d. Secondly, it\u2019s much more convenient as you don\u2019t need all those details such as a bank account number in a specific format to send the money. Their Raast ID \u2014 which can simply be a mobile number, email address or another moniker \u2014 is all that\u2019s required.  ", "It is just a switch system that connects all the financial services intermediaries and brings in interoperability \u2014 to make the transactions, you\u2019d still need to channel the transaction through your bank which is where the real hassle was in the first place", "So far so good, right? But before you get too excited, do remember that Raast is just a switch system that connects all the financial services intermediaries and brings in interoperability. To make the transactions, you\u2019d still need to channel the transaction through your bank which is where the real hassle was in the first place. I mean it doesn\u2019t matter whether you are sending someone money through Raast or 1LINK if the bank\u2019s app is down, which is a routine occurrence for a certain tech company with a banking licence, there is little that can be done.", "The State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s website lists 18 banks that are already offering Raast, of which 14 have it integrated with their e-banking channels while the remaining four have it available only at specific branch counters. \u201cI had registered my Raast ID very early on using my bank\u2019s mobile app and then did a transaction or two. Everything was smooth. But a few days later, when a friend transferred funds using Raast, I did not receive any money even though his app showed the transaction as successful. On calling the bank, they told me I am apparently not registered despite my Raast ID showing up as beneficiary to others,\u201d says Fayaz Hussain. ", "While it might still be early days, a casual audit of banks\u2019 websites doesn\u2019t give a particularly comforting picture. For example, one fine institution simply copy-pasted the SBP\u2019s list on its Raast FAQs (frequently asked questions) page, even the \u201cPlease reach out to your bank regarding limits on Raast transactions\u201d instead of giving its own limit. ", "And that basically emphasises the importance of Raast in potentially bringing some freshness to Pakistan\u2019s moth-eaten financial services industry where boomers assess their performance by the number of memoranda of understanding signed every month. The SBP\u2019s interoperable micropayments gateway will make it easier for new entrants to easily integrate with other entities and enable payments. ", "Secondly, it will open up possibilities for fintechs to develop new use cases on top of Raast. The SBP cites request-to-pay as one such example: \u201cUnder pull payments, a retailer would be able to pull money from the customer\u2019s account, provided there is a confirmation mechanism or a pre-existing authorisation from the customer. A common example of pull payments is direct debit.\u201d", "The regulator is pinning hopes on Raast to promote financial inclusion as well as trigger a further shift towards digital payments, which has seen significant growth since the onset of Covid-19 and the subsequent temporary waiving of IBFT charges. Mobile and internet banking transactions combined surged to Rs10.6 trillion (286.8 million volume) during 2020-21, from Rs4.7tr (139.4m) the previous fiscal year. ", "However, paper transactions still hold considerable weightage as their total value of Rs151.6tr is much larger than the aggregate of e-banking (which also includes primarily cash-based channels like real-time online banking and ATM). That, in essence, shows the potential for digitisation. ", "Moreover, peer-to-peer is just one part of the Raast vision: the other two are bulk payments (which was the first to be launched back in 2021 and has over 30 banks onboard) while the yet-to-be-launched third phase is person-to-merchant payments. Unfortunately, little data has been made available by the SBP on the volume and value of bulk transactions to assess how the uptake has been like. ", " Compunode.com Pvt. Ltd.

The production quality across genres is indicative of a blend of maturity and a new age mood as embodied by former teenage prodigy Abdullah Siddiqui who at 21 is producing for musicians like Meesha Shafi.", "\t\t\t", "This new wave of Pakistani music should not come as a surprise. The talent and creativity were always there, all that was needed was a push into the mainstream. Although multinational corporations played their part by becoming much-needed patrons, it is how those musicians seized the opportunities and opened up the way for others to join them in the spotlight. There is a sense of camaraderie among musicians, with each one quick to support the production and promotion of another\u2019s work. You just know it\u2019s different this time.", "With Spotify entering Pakistan\u2019s music ecosystem, one hopes the platform will provide the required support to the ongoing music revolution in Pakistan, giving artists more ownership of their music and a direct line to their fans, while providing globally competitive rates for their work.", "Although the signs are promising, there is still some way to go for the current generation of musicians to hit the same heights as their trailblazing predecessors. The lack of large-scale music festivals or curatorial organisations is preventing them from interacting with their audiences and building on their existing fan base. There is no reason to believe that this generation will not achieve global success, but they need the support of fans to help create an environment that is conducive to making money while maintaining their artistic credibility.", "\n      For questions regarding subscription and timely delivery, please contact on the following numbers or visit ", "\n      (ISB) +92-51-220-2701-5 \u2022 Plot 12, Sector G-7/1 Mauve Area, Near Zero Point Islamabad, 44000 ", "\n      (KHI) +92-21-3561-3066/7 \u2022 Haroon House Dr. Ziauddin Ahmed Road Karachi, 74200 ", "\n      (LHR) +92-42-3575-8120-25 \u2022 20-N, Gulberg II Lahore, 54660 ", "\n      ", "  \u2022 ", " ", "\n    "]], "picture": [["https://i.dawn.com/primary/2022/03/62259d15e6b7d.png"]], "time": [["10:50am"]], "date": []},
