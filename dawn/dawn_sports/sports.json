These so-called Population III stars are hypothesized as extremely massive, luminous, hot and short-lived, composed almost exclusively of hydrogen and helium.", "\u201cAfter the Big Bang, some regions in space ended up being denser than others, and this attracted progressively more matter. This effect created large concentrations of gas, some of which collapsed to form stars,\u201d said astrophysicist Fabio Pacucci of the Center for Astrophysics-Harvard & Smithsonian, lead author of a related study in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters.", "Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were absent in the universe\u2019s initial stages, forged later inside the earliest stars and then spewed into interstellar space when they exploded at the ends of their life cycles.", "HD1 was observed to possess extreme ultraviolet luminosity. Population III stars could emit more UV light than ordinary stars, with HD1 possibly  \u201cundergoing a very abrupt starburst,\u201d Pacucci said.", "An alternative explanation for the UV luminosity could be a supermassive black hole about 100 million times more massive than our sun situated inside HD1, Pacucci added. Many galaxies including the Milky Way hold supermassive black holes at their centers. Until now, the earliest-known one of these was dated to about 700 million years after the Big Bang. The earliest stars and galaxies paved the way for those existing today.", "\u201cThe first galaxies ... were a millionth of the mass of the Milky Way and much denser. One way to think of them is as the building blocks in the construction project of present-day galaxies, like our own Milky Way,\u201d ", "Harvard University theoretical physicist and study co-author Avi Loeb said.", " Compunode.com Pvt.
